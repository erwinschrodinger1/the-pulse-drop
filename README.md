## 📢 About the Project

**the-pulse-drop** is an open-source initiative building a trusted, privacy-first, verified platform to connect **blood donors** with people in urgent need — responsibly and safely.

Even today, people still rely on:

- Random social media posts  
- Personal networks  
- Luck

There is no unified system with:

- Verified requests  
- Trusted hospitals  
- Location-intelligent donor alerts  
- Privacy protection  
- Donor credit scoring  
- CSR-backed incentives  

**We want to fix that.**

## 🧩 What We Are Building

### ✔ Verified Requests  
Every request is backed with doctor-signed documents, hospital confirmation, and identity verification.

### ✔ Smart Donor Matching  
Radius expands automatically:  
**5km → 10km → 15km → 20km → 30km**

### ✔ Privacy by Design  
Donor contact details are shared **only after the donor accepts the request**.

### ✔ Donor Credit Score  
Increases when donors:  
- Donate on time  
- Maintain a healthy profile  
- Respond quickly  
- Complete identity & health checks  

Unlocks:  
- Insurance benefits  
- Health discounts  
- Priority approvals  

### ✔ CSR & Health Rewards  
Companies can offer:  
- Pharmacy discounts  
- Checkups  
- Health coupons  
- Insurance perks  

### ✔ Donor Community  
Leaderboards, volunteer IDs, city groups, milestones.
